## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: BPM data must come from external API (GetSongBPM), not Spotify Audio Features (deprecated Nov 2024)
- [Roadmap]: CMPedometer for cadence detection (not raw accelerometer), lower risk path
- [Roadmap]: Phase 2 (BPM Pipeline) before Phase 3 (Cadence) to validate biggest technical risk early

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: GetSongBPM API coverage and rate limits are unverified. Phase 2 planning must address this.
- [Research]: SPTAppRemote background reconnection reliability unknown. Phase 1 must test this.
